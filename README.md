# Choice-Modeling-Assortment-Optimization-and-Pricing
The first part of the project involved building a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. 
The MNL model helps estimate the parameters of the various features that influence customers' choices, such as hotel brand, pricing, location.
By understanding customer preferences, we decide assortment of products to offer to maximize revenue. 
With the MNL model and parameter estimates in hand, we also perform pricing optimization.
